![Hi there](./hi_there.png)
-----

My name is Kees van Voorthuizen â€” I'm a 17-years-old Dutch full stack
developer and CTO & Co-Founder of [Tribecamp](https://tribecamp.com).
I'm a huge fan of modern web frameworks, and I like learning new things.
I have 4-5 years of experience with C#.NET, but nowadays I'm really
into web development and creating scalable backends with Node.js.

I absolutely love working with GNU/Linux environments. I'm using Artix Linux
with the [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) window manager at
the moment and I've dealt with Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro and Mint
in the past. Vim and Visual Studio Code are my preferred text editors.

My first ever experience with Linux was around the age of ten. At the time I got
an old computer with an empty hard disk from my aunt, on which I then installed
Ubuntu with LXDE on the advice of an acquaintance. I have become addicted to
computers, programming and tech ever since.

One of my future goals is to learn and fully understand the C language (and C++).
I'm also very interested in the Rust language and I'm quite familiar with Java
and Python.

Feel free to reach out! ðŸ¤“
